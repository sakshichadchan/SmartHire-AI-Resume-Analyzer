------------------
Step 6: turn the skill-gap result into (1) learning recommendations + roadmap and
(2) resume-improvement suggestions.

INTEGRITY RULE: nothing here invents qualifications. Suggestions tell the user to add a skill ONLY if they
genuinely have it; otherwise the skill is presented as a learning goal.
